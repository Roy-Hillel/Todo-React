Hi welcome to my first MERN project.
This project is a simple Todo app to organize and keep track of your daily tasks.
The app mainly uses React, NodeJS, MongoDB, express and axios.

To run the app:

- run the command 'npm install' in react-todo/client
- run the command 'npm install' in react-todo/backend
- create a file named 'connectionSTR.js' in react-todo/backend
- in connectionSTR.js - export const connectionStr = `<your connection string to mongoDB>`
- run the command 'npm start' in react-todo/client
- run the command 'npm start' in react-todo/backend - this will run in nodemon state

Enjoy!
